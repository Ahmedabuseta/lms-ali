# Introduction to Calculus

## Overview

Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change, just as geometry is the study of shape, and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations.

## Key Concepts

### Limits

The concept of limits is fundamental to calculus. A limit is the value that a function approaches as the input approaches some value.

<Info title="Definition">
  The limit of a function $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is written as:
  
  $$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$$
  
  This means that as $x$ gets closer and closer to $a$, $f(x)$ gets closer and closer to $L$.

### Derivatives

The derivative represents the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable.

<Card>
  The derivative of a function $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is defined as:
  
  $$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$$
  
  This represents the instantaneous rate of change of $f(x)$ at point $x$.
</Card>

<Warning title="Common Mistake">
  Don't confuse the average rate of change with the instantaneous rate of change. The former is calculated over an interval, while the latter is calculated at a specific point.
</Warning>

## Example Problems

### Problem 1

Find the derivative of $f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2$

<Details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  
  Using the power rule and linearity of derivatives:
  
  $$f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + 3x + 2)$$
  $$f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^2) + \frac{d}{dx}(3x) + \frac{d}{dx}(2)$$
  $$f'(x) = 2x + 3 + 0$$
  $$f'(x) = 2x + 3$$
</Details>

## Interactive Practice

Try to solve these problems:

1. Find the limit: $\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}$
2. Calculate the derivative of $g(x) = \sin(x) \cdot \cos(x)$
